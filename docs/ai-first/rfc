# RFC Update - AI Touchpoints Section

## AI Touchpoints

ShopLite will implement two high-impact AI capabilities in the initial sprint to directly address conversion and support efficiency challenges:

**Smart Product Search** - Enables natural language product discovery to reduce search abandonment and improve conversion rates. Users can search with phrases like "comfortable running shoes under $150" instead of exact keywords.

**Support Chat Assistant** - Provides instant resolution for common customer inquiries (order status, shipping, returns) to reduce support ticket volume by 45% while improving customer satisfaction.

Both touchpoints leverage existing data sources (product catalog, FAQ/policies, order API) with clear fallback mechanisms and human escalation paths. Implementation targets 300ms search latency and 1200ms support response times.

For detailed specifications, capability analysis, and cost projections, see our [AI Capability Map](/docs/ai-first/ai-capability-map.md).

**Next Steps**: Feasibility prototypes for semantic search and order status chatbot, followed by A/B testing with 5% traffic allocation.
