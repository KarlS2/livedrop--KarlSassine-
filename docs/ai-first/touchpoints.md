# AI Touchpoint Specifications

## 1. Smart Product Search

### Problem Statement
Customers struggle to find products using traditional keyword search, leading to high bounce rates and poor conversion. Users often search with natural language descriptions like "comfortable running shoes for flat feet" or "wireless headphones under $100" but our current search only matches exact keywords, missing relevant products and frustrating users who then abandon their shopping journey.

### Happy Path
1. User types natural language query in search box: "bluetooth speakers for outdoor parties"
2. Query preprocessed to extract intent, price range, features, and context
3. Vector similarity search against product embeddings with semantic matching
4. Results filtered by availability, price preferences, and user location
5. AI reranks results based on relevance score and business priorities
6. Search results displayed with AI-generated explanation snippets
7. User clicks on relevant product and proceeds to purchase
8. Search interaction logged for model improvement and personalization

### Grounding & Guardrails
- **Source of truth**: Product catalog database with SKU details, descriptions, prices, availability
- **Retrieval scope**: Active products only (in-stock or low-stock), max 50 candidate products
- **Max context**: 2K tokens for product descriptions + query
- **Refuse outside scope**: Redirect non-product queries to support or site search

### Human-in-the-Loop
- **Escalation triggers**: No results found (confidence < 0.3), inappropriate content detected
- **UI surface**: "Can't find what you're looking for?" with human chat option
- **Reviewer**: Customer success team reviews failed searches daily
- **SLA**: 4-hour response for escalated search issues

### Latency Budget
- Query preprocessing: 50ms
- Vector search: 100ms
- AI reranking: 100ms
- Result formatting: 30ms
- Cache lookup: 20ms
- **Total target**: 300ms (70% cache hit reduces avg to 150ms)

### Error & Fallback Behavior
- Primary: Fall back to keyword search with original query
- Secondary: Show popular products in relevant category
- Error logging: Track failed queries for model retraining
- User message: "Showing keyword results for [query]"

### PII Handling
- **What leaves app**: Query text only (no user identifiers)
- **Redaction rules**: Remove email, phone, address patterns from queries
- **Logging policy**: Store anonymized search queries for 90 days, no user linking

### Success Metrics
- **Product metrics**: Search-to-click rate >15%, search result relevance score >4.0/5
- **Business metric**: Search-driven conversion rate increase by 8%

### Feasibility Note
Product catalog is available via existing API with descriptions and metadata. We'll use OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 for semantic search with Pinecone vector DB. Next prototype step: Build semantic search MVP with 100 products to test query understanding and result relevance before full catalog integration.

## 2. Support Chat Assistant

### Problem Statement
Customer support requests overwhelm human agents with repetitive questions about order status, shipping policies, and return procedures, leading to long response times (4+ hours) and frustrated customers. 80% of support tickets are simple informational requests that could be resolved instantly, but customers currently wait in queue or browse complex FAQ pages unsuccessfully.

### Happy Path
1. User clicks "Need Help?" and describes issue: "Where is my order #12345?"
2. AI parses intent and identifies order status inquiry
3. System calls order-status API with extracted order ID
4. AI retrieves current status, tracking info, and estimated delivery
5. Response generated with personalized update and proactive next steps
6. User receives instant answer with tracking link and delivery timeline
7. Chat offers related help: "Need to change delivery address?"
8. Session marked as resolved, escalation option always available

### Grounding & Guardrails
- **Source of truth**: Order database, FAQ/policies markdown, shipping provider APIs
- **Retrieval scope**: User's orders only, public policies, no other customer data
- **Max context**: 4K tokens (order details + policies + conversation history)
- **Refuse outside scope**: Technical issues, account changes, complex disputes â†’ human handoff

### Human-in-the-Loop
- **Escalation triggers**: Confidence <0.7, angry sentiment, complex request, payment issues
- **UI surface**: "Let me connect you with a specialist" button always visible
- **Reviewer**: Support agents handle escalated conversations
- **SLA**: Human response within 15 minutes for escalated chats

### Latency Budget
- Intent classification: 200ms
- API data retrieval: 400ms
- Response generation: 500ms
- Response formatting: 100ms
- **Total target**: 1200ms (30% cache hit for common questions)

### Error & Fallback Behavior
- API failures: "I'm having trouble accessing your order details. Let me connect you with an agent."
- Model failures: Show relevant FAQ section and human chat option
- Invalid order IDs: "I can't find that order number. Can you double-check or try our order lookup page?"

### PII Handling
- **What leaves app**: Order ID, general inquiry type (no customer names/addresses)
- **Redaction rules**: Mask credit card numbers, SSNs, full addresses before processing
- **Logging policy**: Store conversation summaries (not full text) for 30 days, purge PII

### Success Metrics
- **Product metrics**: Resolution rate >75%, user satisfaction >4.5/5, avg session duration <2 minutes
- **Business metric**: Support ticket volume reduction of around 45%

### Feasibility Note
Order-status API exists and FAQ/policies are in markdown format. We'll use GenAI (ex:GPT-4o-mini) for conversation handling with function calling for API integration. Next prototype step: Build order status lookup chatbot with 5 common inquiry types to validate response quality and API integration patterns.
