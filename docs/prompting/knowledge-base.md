# Shoplite Knowledge Base

## Document 1: Shoplite User Registration Process

To sign up to Shoplite, you need to visit the signup page at shoplite. com/register and submit some basic information such as valid e-mail address, safe password (min 8 characters containing at least one upper case letter,one lower case letter,one number and one special character) and profile information like full name and mobile phone number. The email verification process is mandatory and must be completed within 24 hours of registration to activate the account.

Once the basic information are filled, users can select one from between two account types. Buyer profiles are totally free and require email validation only. They provide instant access to shop the products. However, seller accounts need more business verifications such as business name or tax ID number and business address.

The verification process for seller accounts typically takes 2-3 business days as our team reviews submitted documents to ensure compliance with platform standards. Once approved, sellers gain access to inventory management tools, analytics dashboards, and payment processing systems. Users can upgrade from buyer to seller accounts at any time by completing the business verification process through their account settings.

All new users must agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy during registration. Password recovery options can be set up immediately, including security questions and backup email addresses for enhanced account security.

## Document 2: Shoplite Shopping Cart Features

The Shoplite shopping cart is designed for flexibility and convenience, allowing users to add multiple items from different sellers in a single shopping session. Each item added to the cart displays the seller name, product image, price, selected quantity, and any applicable variants such as size or color. The cart automatically calculates subtotals, applicable taxes, and estimated shipping costs based on the delivery address.

Cart contents are preserved across sessions for logged-in users, meaning items remain in the cart even after closing the browser or switching devices. Guest users can also use the shopping cart, but their selections are stored temporarily using browser cookies and will be lost after 7 days of inactivity or when cookies are cleared.

Cart interface has quantity adjustment handles where users could add, subtract or remove items. A “Save for Later” feature lets you lift items out of the active cart without erasing them, a handy way to compare options or wait for sales. Those saved items appear in their own section and can be moved back to the cart all at once with one click.

Promotional codes or discount coupons can be added in the cart before you checkout. The system validates codes in real-time and displays the discounted total immediately. Users are also able to view specific shipping methods and costs prior to placing an order, which allows them to make informed choices about preferred delivery.

## Document 3: Shoplite Product Search and Filtering

Shoplite's search engine allows to easily find product using multiple search method and several filters. The search bar accepts: product names,brands, keywords or an item number (including sku) using intelligent search algorithms to help you find the perfect fit as you type.
Search results are presented with product thumbnails, prices, ratings and seller information so you can easily find the right product.

The filtering system has multiple criteria to help you narrow your search and find the product you are looking for! You can filter by price range (using a sliding scale), filter out select brands among the checkbox list, see product conditions (new, refurbished, used) and sort by customer ratings. More filters available include seller location, shipping options (free delivery, expedited delivery), and product availability (in stock, pre-order).

If you don't have something specific in mind, category browsing is available from the homepage. Products are sorted by category and more to help make your selection process easier. You’ll find subcategories within those for further specific browsing. For instance Electronics have sub categories such as Smartphones, Laptops, Cameras and Audio equipment.

Sorting options allow users to sort results by relevance, price (low to high and high to low), customer ratings, new arrivals or best sellers. Recent searches are stored, and suggestions provided to help you quickly access them. Users can also save searches to receive alerts when matching new products are listed, or when prices drop on items they are interested in buying.

## Document 4: Shoplite Payment Methods and Security

Shoplite supports multiple methods of payment to suit different customer preferences. Major credit and debit cards (Visa, Mastercard...) are handled by our secure payment processor with PCI DSS certification. Digital wallets like PayPal, Apple Pay and Google Pay provide an instant checkout for users who have a wallet set up with their payment details.

Bank transfer and direct debit payment options are available to make bulk purchases, but these require 2-3 days to clear payments before orders are processed. Shoplite also enables installments through partners like Klarna and Affirm on purchases over $100 with others, allowing customers to pay monthly over time with different interest rates based on credit approval.

All payment details transmitted between your browser and our website are encrypted using 256bit SSL to ensure security of sensitive information. We do not retain full credit card numbers, which have been tokenized with security tokens. Our payment processing partners are certified as adhering to the highest security and compliance standards, and they are audited annually for compliance with these high standards.

For added security, we deploy fraud-detection systems designed to watch over transactions for unusual activity patterns. All purchases can be protected by two-factor authentication, which ensures users must confirm a purchase via email or SMS before it goes through. Payment details are not disclosed to sellers; it’s an escrow system where shoplite processes payment and disburses the sum to the seller upon successful order completion. Customers will also receive a detailed payment receipt via email upon completion and can access their entire payment history from the account dashboard.

## Document 5: Shoplite Order Tracking and Delivery

Once an order is placed, customers receive a confirmation email with a unique order number and estimated delivery time. Order tracking begins as soon as the seller ships the item and uploads tracking information to the Shoplite system. Customers can monitor their orders through the "My Orders" section in their account dashboard or by entering their order number on the tracking page.

The tracking service shows real-time updates of order status including all post-purchase steps such as: order confirmation, payment verification, seller preparation, item shipment dispatch and finally delivery completion. Every status update is accompanied by an indication of such, along with the corresponding date and place. Customers receive automatic email (and optional SMS) notifications at important purchase stages, e.g. when your product is dispatched or out for delivery to the recipient.

Delivery timeframes vary based on shipping method selection. Standard shipping typically takes 5-7 business days, expedited shipping takes 2-3 business days, and express overnight shipping delivers within 1 business day for orders placed before 2 PM. International orders have extended delivery windows of 10-21 business days depending on destination country and customs processing.

Shoplite works with most popular carriers, such as FedEx, UPS, USPS and DHL. To track packages, customers can view the carrier that is shipping their order and simply click on the link to the carrier’s tracking system. For valuable shipments, a signature may be required upon receipt. In cases of unsuccessful delivery, delivery services usually leave a notice with specific instruction for package pick-up at nearby locations or rescheduling the delivery.

## Document 6: Shoplite Return and Refund Policies

Shoplite has a customer-friendly return policy allowing returns within 30 days of delivery for most products. Items must be in original condition with all tags, labels, and packaging intact. The product should be unused, unworn, and in the same condition as received. Digital products, personalized items, intimate apparel, and perishable goods are generally non-returnable unless defective.

To begin the return process, customers will need to sign into their account and go to "My Orders", select the order containing the item they want to return, and click on "Request Return". The system walks users through choosing return reasons and uploading photos if the item is damaged or defective. Return requests are reviewed within 24 to 48h. Once the return request is approved, customers get a prepaid return shipping label in email.

The cost of the return shipping will be based on the reason for the return. Shoplite will cover the cost of return shipping if the item is defective, damaged (through no fault of your own), or incorrect. For returns due to the change of mind or sizing issue, return shipping cost is the responsibility of the customer which gets deduced from the refund amount. Items need to be returned no more than 14 days from date of approval in order to qualify.

Refunds are processed within 5-7 business days after the returned item is received and inspected at our facility. The refund amount is credited to the original payment method used for purchase. For store credit option, customers receive an additional 10% bonus credit that can be used for future purchases. Partial refunds may apply if items are returned without original packaging or show signs of use beyond inspection.

## Document 7: Shoplite Product Reviews and Ratings

Shoplite’s reviews enable verified buyers – people who have purchased the product in question – to feedback on their purchase, assisting other shoppers make informed choices about what they buy, this helps to reduce fake reviews and maintain the authenticity factor. The review period begins 3 days following delivery, and lasts for 90 days after purchase.

Reviews are star rated (1-5 stars) with the option of leaving a written review. Customers can also post pictures and videos of the product in use, up to 5 per submission, that give other shoppers important visual context. The review form itself contains questions relating to, for example, product quality, description accuracy and value for money as well as the behaviour of seller to help cover most aspects in substantive customer feedback.

All submitted reviews undergo moderation to ensure they meet community guidelines. Reviews containing profanity, personal attacks, competitor promotions, or content unrelated to the product are rejected. The moderation process typically takes 24-48 hours, after which approved reviews appear on the product page. Sellers can respond to reviews to address concerns or thank customers for positive feedback.

The review system calculates the average of all star ratings specified on the product detail page. Reviews can be sorted by helpfuless (based on votes by other users), most recent or highest/lowest ratings. There are also verified purchase badges next to reviews from verified buyers, so it feels a bit more credible. Our customers can receive "Top Reviewer" awards and get their reviews published on the corner of each page for the entire product they own. The system also identifies potentially biased reviews from accounts with suspicious activity patterns.

## Document 8: Shoplite Seller Account Setup and Management

Becoming a Shoplite seller requires completing a comprehensive registration and verification process. Prospective sellers must first create a basic Shoplite account, then navigate to the Seller Central portal to begin the business application. The application requires business information including legal business name, tax identification number (EIN or SSN for sole proprietors), business address, and bank account details for payment deposits.

Business verification is mandatory and includes document submission such as business licenses, tax registration certificates, and government-issued ID. The verification team reviews applications within 2-3 business days, checking for compliance with legal requirements and platform policies. Some sellers may be asked to provide additional documentation during this process. Once approved, sellers gain immediate access to the Seller Dashboard with full functionality.

The Seller Dashboard provides comprehensive tools for managing inventory, processing orders, communicating with customers, and analyzing sales performance. Sellers can create product listings with descriptions, images, pricing, and inventory quantities. The bulk upload feature allows adding multiple products simultaneously via CSV files, significantly reducing setup time for large catalogs.

Seller accounts include different subscription tiers. The Basic tier is free but includes a per-transaction fee of 12% and limited listing features. The Professional tier costs $39.99 monthly, reduces transaction fees to 8%, and unlocks advanced analytics, promotional tools, and priority customer support. Enterprise sellers with high volume can negotiate custom terms. All sellers must maintain performance metrics including order fulfillment rate above 95%, response time under 24 hours, and customer satisfaction rating above 4.0 stars to remain in good standing.

## Document 9: Shoplite Inventory Management for Sellers

Effective inventory management is crucial for seller success on Shoplite. The inventory management system allows sellers to track stock levels, set low-stock alerts, and automate inventory updates across multiple sales channels. Sellers can manage inventory from the Seller Dashboard under the "Inventory" tab, where all products are listed with current stock quantities, SKU numbers, and status indicators.

Adding inventory is straightforward through manual entry or bulk upload. For manual entry, sellers input product details including title, description, category, price, quantity available, and product images (minimum 3, maximum 10 images per listing). The bulk upload feature accepts CSV files following Shoplite's template format, enabling hundreds of products to be added or updated simultaneously. This feature automatically validates data and flags errors before finalizing uploads.

Stock level automation helps prevent overselling. When a product sells, inventory automatically decrements by the purchased quantity. Sellers can set minimum stock thresholds that trigger email alerts, allowing timely reordering. The system can also automatically pause listings when inventory reaches zero, preventing orders for out-of-stock items. Integration with third-party inventory management software is available through API connections for sellers managing inventory across multiple platforms.

Inventory reports provide insights into stock movement, best-selling products, slow-moving items, and inventory value. The system tracks inventory turnover rates and suggests pricing adjustments for items with extended shelf time. Sellers can also implement inventory reservations, where stock is temporarily held during the checkout process to prevent simultaneous purchases exceeding available quantity. Seasonal inventory planning tools help sellers forecast demand and optimize stock levels based on historical sales data.

## Document 10: Shoplite Commission and Fee Structure

Understanding Shoplite's fee structure is essential for sellers to price products competitively while maintaining profitability. The platform operates on a commission-based model where fees are deducted from each sale before disbursing funds to sellers. Fee structure varies based on seller subscription tier and product category, ensuring fairness across different business models.

Basic tier sellers pay a flat 12% commission on each sale plus a $0.30 transaction fee per order. Professional tier sellers ($39.99 monthly subscription) benefit from reduced commission rates of 8% plus the same $0.30 transaction fee. Enterprise sellers with annual sales exceeding $500,000 can negotiate custom commission rates, typically ranging from 5-7%. These fees cover payment processing, platform maintenance, customer support, and fraud protection services.

Category-specific commissions apply to certain product types. Electronics and high-value items carry a 10% commission rate (8% for Professional tier) due to higher support and fraud prevention costs. Fashion and apparel maintain standard rates. Books, media, and digital products have reduced commissions of 6% to encourage content diversity. Handmade and artisan products receive preferential 7% rates to support small creators.

Additional fees may apply for optional services. Featured product listings cost $5 per week per product, placing items prominently in category pages. Promoted listings through Shoplite's advertising platform operate on a cost-per-click model with minimum $10 daily budgets. Currency conversion fees of 2.5% apply to international transactions. Return processing fees of $3 per return are charged when customers utilize prepaid return labels. All fees are transparently displayed in the Seller Dashboard, and comprehensive monthly statements detail all charges and commissions for accounting purposes.

Customers can access support through live chat (available 9 AM - 9 PM EST), email support (24/7 response within 24 hours), phone support for urgent issues, and a comprehensive help center with articles covering common questions. The support system uses intelligent routing to direct inquiries to specialized teams based on issue type.

A robust search function helps users find relevant articles quickly. Each article includes step-by-step instructions with screenshots and video tutorials where applicable. The system tracks article helpfulness through user feedback, continuously improving content based on customer needs.

For direct support, customers should first log into their accounts to access personalized assistance. Logged-in users receive faster service as support agents can immediately view order history, account details, and previous interactions. When contacting support, customers should provide their order number, detailed description of the issue, and any relevant screenshots or documentation. This information helps support agents resolve issues efficiently, often within the first interaction.

Support tickets are prioritized based on urgency and issue type. Critical issues like payment failures or account security concerns receive immediate attention, typically resolved within 2-4 hours. Standard inquiries about orders or products are addressed within 24 hours. General questions may take up to 48 hours during peak periods.

## Document 13: Shoplite API Documentation for Developers

Shoplite offers a comprehensive RESTful API enabling developers to integrate platform functionality into third-party applications, build custom tools, and automate business processes. The API provides programmatic access to product catalogs, order management, inventory updates, customer data, and analytics. API access requires registration through the Developer Portal and obtaining API credentials including an API key and secret.

The API follows RESTful principles with standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and returns responses in JSON format. Authentication uses OAuth 2.0 protocol, ensuring secure access to platform resources. Developers must include the API key in request headers for all endpoints. Rate limiting applies to prevent abuse, allowing 1000 requests per hour for standard accounts and 5000 requests per hour for premium accounts. Exceeding rate limits results in temporary throttling with clear error messages indicating wait times.

Key API endpoints include product listing management (create, update, delete listings), inventory management (real-time stock updates), order processing (retrieve order details, update order status), customer management (access customer information with proper permissions), and webhook subscriptions (receive real-time notifications for specific events like new orders or inventory changes). Each endpoint includes detailed documentation with request parameters, response formats, and example code in multiple programming languages including Python, JavaScript, PHP, and Ruby.

The API documentation portal provides interactive testing tools allowing developers to make API calls directly from the browser to understand request-response patterns. Sandbox environment availability enables testing without affecting production data. Comprehensive error code documentation helps developers troubleshoot issues quickly. The API maintains backward compatibility, with deprecated endpoints receiving 6-month advance notice before removal. Developer support is available through dedicated forums, email support, and monthly webinars covering API updates and best practices.

## Document 14: Shoplite Security and Privacy Policies

Security and privacy are foundational principles at Shoplite, reflected in comprehensive policies and technical implementations protecting user data. All data transmissions use 256-bit SSL/TLS encryption, ensuring information remains secure during transfer between users' devices and Shoplite servers. Our infrastructure includes multiple security layers including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and regular security audits by independent third-party firms.

User data is stored in secure, geographically distributed data centers with redundant backups and disaster recovery protocols. Access to customer data is strictly limited to authorized personnel who require it for legitimate business purposes, and all access is logged and monitored. Employee security training is mandatory, covering data protection principles, phishing awareness, and incident response procedures. Background checks are conducted on all employees with data access privileges.

Privacy policy transparency is central to our operations. We collect only necessary information for platform functionality including account details, purchase history, payment information, shipping addresses, and browsing behavior for personalization. We never sell personal information to third parties. Data sharing occurs only with essential service providers like payment processors and shipping carriers, bound by contractual confidentiality agreements. Users have full control over data sharing preferences through privacy settings in their account dashboard.

Users can exercise data rights including accessing their stored data, requesting data portability in machine-readable formats, correcting inaccurate information, and requesting account deletion. Account deletion requests are processed within 30 days, permanently removing personal data except where legal retention requirements apply (such as tax records and dispute resolution documentation). Two-factor authentication is available for enhanced account security, and we recommend enabling it for all accounts, especially seller accounts handling financial transactions.

## Document 15: Shoplite Promotional Codes and Discounts

Shoplite's promotional system enables both platform-wide campaigns and seller-specific discounts, providing value to customers while driving sales. Promotional codes are alphanumeric strings entered during checkout to receive discounts. Codes are case-sensitive and must be entered exactly as provided. The system validates codes in real-time, displaying applicable discounts immediately and adjusting order totals before payment.

Several promotional code types exist on the platform. Percentage discounts reduce order total by a specified percentage (e.g., SAVE20 for 20% off). Fixed amount discounts provide specific dollar reductions (e.g., GET10OFF for $10 discount). Free shipping codes waive shipping charges regardless of order value. Buy-one-get-one (BOGO) promotions apply automatically when qualifying items are added to cart. Category-specific codes apply only to products within designated categories.

Promotional codes include usage restrictions and eligibility criteria. Minimum purchase requirements may apply, requiring orders to reach specific thresholds before codes activate. Maximum discount caps limit total savings even for high-value orders. Some codes are single-use only, while others allow multiple applications by the same user. Expiration dates are enforced strictly, with expired codes rejected at checkout. New customer codes require account age verification, available only to users registered within the past 30 days.

Customers can discover promotional codes through multiple channels. Email subscribers receive exclusive codes for platform sales and special events. Social media followers get early access to limited-time promotions. The Shoplite app features a "Deals" section aggregating active promotions and codes. Third-party coupon websites may share codes, though Shoplite doesn't control external listings. Sellers can create custom codes for their products through the Seller Dashboard, setting discount percentages, usage limits, and validity periods. Stacking multiple codes is generally prohibited, with the system applying whichever code provides greater savings.

## Document 16: Shoplite Seller Performance Metrics and Requirements

Maintaining high seller performance standards is essential for continued access to Shoplite's platform and customer base. The platform monitors seller performance across multiple metrics, displayed in the Seller Dashboard with color-coded indicators showing performance status. Sellers must maintain minimum thresholds across all metrics to remain in good standing and avoid account restrictions.

The Order Defect Rate (ODR) measures negative customer experiences including product not received claims, significantly not as described claims, and credit card chargebacks. Sellers must maintain ODR below 1%, meaning fewer than 1 in 100 orders can result in these issues. High ODR indicates systemic problems with product quality, shipping reliability, or listing accuracy. Consistent ODR violations result in account warnings, selling restrictions, or permanent suspension.

Order fulfillment metrics track shipping performance. Pre-fulfillment cancel rate must stay below 2.5%, as excessive cancellations frustrate customers and harm platform reputation. Late shipment rate should remain under 4%, with orders shipped within the promised handling time frame. Valid tracking rate requires at least 95% of orders to have working tracking numbers uploaded within handling time. These metrics ensure customers receive orders promptly with visibility into shipment status.

Customer service metrics evaluate seller responsiveness and satisfaction. Response time to customer messages must average under 24 hours, demonstrating commitment to addressing customer concerns promptly. Customer satisfaction rating, based on post-purchase surveys, should maintain 4.0 stars or higher on a 5-star scale. Policy compliance violations are tracked separately, with violations for prohibited items, intellectual property infringement, or terms of service breaches resulting in immediate penalties.

Performance reviews occur monthly, with underperforming sellers receiving notifications detailing specific metrics requiring improvement. Sellers have 30 days to address performance issues before escalating consequences. Severe or repeated violations may result in temporary selling privileges suspension or permanent account termination. High-performing sellers with excellent metrics may qualify for benefits including reduced commission rates, featured seller badges, and priority customer support access.

## Document 17: Shoplite Product Listing Best Practices

Creating effective product listings is crucial for seller success on Shoplite, directly impacting visibility, conversion rates, and customer satisfaction. High-quality listings combine accurate information, compelling visuals, and strategic keyword usage to attract and convert potential buyers. Following best practices ensures listings comply with platform policies while maximizing sales potential.

Product titles should be clear, descriptive, and keyword-rich without being spammy. Include essential information like brand, product type, key features, size, color, and quantity. Titles should be 60-200 characters, balancing descriptiveness with readability. Avoid ALL CAPS, excessive punctuation, or promotional language like "BEST DEAL EVER." Poor example: "Amazing SALE!!! Shoes - Great Price!!!!" Good example: "Nike Air Max 270 Men's Running Shoes, Size 10, Black/White, Breathable Mesh."

Product descriptions require comprehensive details helping customers make informed decisions. Include product dimensions, materials, functionality, compatibility information, and care instructions. Use paragraph breaks and bullet points for readability. Describe benefits, not just features - explain how the product solves problems or improves the customer's life. Maintain honest, accurate descriptions matching the actual product to avoid returns and negative reviews.

Image quality significantly impacts conversion rates. Listings require minimum 3 images, but 7-10 images optimal. Primary image should show the product on white background, meeting Shoplite's guidelines. Additional images should display multiple angles, close-up details, scale references, products in use, and packaging contents. Images must be high-resolution (minimum 1000x1000 pixels), well-lit, and accurately represent product color and condition. Videos increase engagement and can showcase product functionality effectively.

Pricing strategy affects both visibility and sales. Research competitor pricing for similar products to remain competitive. Factor in all costs including product cost, Shoplite commissions, shipping, and desired profit margin. Consider promotional pricing strategies for new listings to build initial reviews and sales velocity. Shipping costs should be transparent and competitive - offering free shipping by building costs into product price often increases conversion rates substantially.

## Document 18: Shoplite Dispute Resolution and Buyer Protection

Shoplite's dispute resolution system protects buyers and sellers when conflicts arise regarding orders. The platform mediates disputes fairly, gathering evidence from both parties before reaching decisions. Understanding the dispute process helps users navigate conflicts effectively and achieve satisfactory resolutions.

Common dispute types include items not received, items significantly different from description, defective or damaged products, and unauthorized transactions. Buyers should first attempt resolution directly with sellers through Shoplite's messaging system, as many issues can be resolved quickly through direct communication. If seller communication fails or sellers are unresponsive for 48 hours, buyers can escalate to formal dispute resolution.

Initiating disputes requires accessing "My Orders," selecting the problematic order, and clicking "Open Dispute." The system guides users through providing dispute details, selecting dispute reason, and uploading supporting evidence like photos, videos, or communication records. Comprehensive evidence strengthens cases significantly. Once submitted, sellers receive notification and have 3 business days to respond with their perspective and counter-evidence.

The dispute review process involves Shoplite's specialized dispute resolution team analyzing all submitted information objectively. Review typically takes 5-7 business days for standard cases, though complex disputes may require longer. The team may request additional information from either party during review. Decisions consider evidence quality, platform policies, seller performance history, and precedent from similar cases.

Possible dispute resolutions include full refunds to buyers, partial refunds reflecting item condition or missing components, return requirements where buyers ship items back for full refunds, or dispute denial if evidence supports seller's position. All resolution decisions are final unless new evidence emerges. Buyer Protection guarantees ensure eligible purchases are protected - if items don't arrive or don't match descriptions, buyers receive refunds. Protection covers purchases up to $2,500 per transaction, providing confidence when shopping on the platform. Repeated frivolous disputes from buyers or consistent dispute losses for sellers result in account reviews and potential restrictions.
